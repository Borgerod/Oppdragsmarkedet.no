Note: Bit of a learning curve since I am new to svelte. But I think I have the hang of it now.

Oppdragsmarkedet.no is a web platform designed to connect people seeking to post or find freelance jobs, assignments, gigs, or project-based work opportunities. Built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), this project is structured for easy contribution and scalability.
